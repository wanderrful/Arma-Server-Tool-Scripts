/*



Bugs (all in a dedicated server context):
	-	When starting the mission, all AI that are disabled will spawn and then immediately be killed (maybe b/c i didn't do disableAI=1; in the description.ext?)
	-	Some of the levels do not spawn the enemies properly
	-	For all levels, the "level" does not properly despawn or even detect that the level has been completed when all enemy units are killed.
